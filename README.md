# Task 4: Logistic Regression – Breast Cancer Dataset

Hi!! This repository contains my implementation of binary classification using Logistic Regression applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  
The goal was to build, evaluate, and interpret a model that predicts whether a tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).

---

## What This Task Covers

- Import and preprocess the dataset  
- Encode target variable (M=1, B=0)  
- Remove unnecessary columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`)  
- Standardize features for better model convergence  
- Train a LogisticRegression model using Scikit-learn  
- Evaluate the model using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - ROC-AUC score
- Tune decision threshold to see effect on predictions  
- Plot the Sigmoid function to understand logistic regression output

---

## Key Learnings

- How logistic regression maps inputs to probabilities using the sigmoid function  
- The importance of feature scaling in models like logistic regression  
- Why evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (like precision, recall, ROC-AUC) matter in classification tasks  
- How changing the classification threshold affects model predictions

---

## Tools Used (Kaggle, Google Colab)

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, metrics)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for plotting
